Raw data will not necessarily be stored in the github.

Genome metadata is acquired from the bn10.bucket. It's in the file
named something like table_BN10_WGS_metadata_03282018.txt

I got the tree directly from Mathieu via email (subject line: tree) on
4/27/2018.

The raw genomes are also from the BN10 bucket, and are stored on the 
almlab node in ~/users/lab/bn10_genomes.

The data in rgi_mapped was made by scripts in src/data.

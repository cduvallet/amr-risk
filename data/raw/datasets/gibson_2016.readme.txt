# Downloading data

The SRA Run Table metadata seems to label every other sample as having 'PAIRED' or 'SINGLE' layout,
but if I click on these samples to see the details, it looks like all of them have two reads per spot...

e.g. this sample is PAIRED: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?run=SRR3132489
and this one is SINGLE: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?run=SRR3132490

But the PAIRED sample has 100% of spots with paired reads, whereas the SINGLE sample has only 15% of spots with a pair...

Also, note that this data includes WGS as well as 16S, and (I think) functional metagenomics libraries (samples labeled FMG, with `Assay Type` `OTHER`).

```ipython
Assay_Type
AMPLICON    124
OTHER       182
WGS         800

# Checking that the 'OTHER' is just functional metagenomics samples
df.query('Assay_Type == "OTHER"')['Library_Name'].str.split('_').str[0].unique()
array(['FMG'], dtype=object)
```

Okay, let's only use the WGS samples. I'm not sure why some samples are labeled as SINGLE
but then have a few reverse reads - let's split spots for all of these data...

```bash
grep WGS gibson_2016.sraruntable.txt | cut -f 13 > gibson_2016.accession_list.txt
while read a; do fastq-dump --accession $a --split-files --outdir gibson_2016/; done < gibson_2016.accession_list.txt 
```

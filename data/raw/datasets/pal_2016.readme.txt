# Downloading data 

Following these directions: ftp://ftp.metagenomics.anl.gov/projects/README.ftp

> e.g. download the original uploaded sequence file:
>   http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov//download/mgm4440442.4?file=050.1

So I did:

wget http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/download/mgm4701410.3?file=050.1

Ughhh ok need to come back to this.

Note: my notes say to only download four of these, but I don't see the other samples anywhere in my spreadsheet.
Look for the dataset with the other samples, to decide whether to donwload those as well or not!
